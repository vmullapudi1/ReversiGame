ReversiGame Readme
----------------------------------------------------------------
Vishruth Mullapudi, CS 2336.001 F17 Final Project.
How to run program:
Run the main method in Reversi_Main (recommended, produces board state records to System.out)
-or-
Run the ReversiGame.jar (doesn't print board states to system.out, only current board and no previous moves visible due to output being in dialog boxes)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Features:
Diagonal move implemented
Player vs player implemented
CPU VS CPU implemented (should result in different games no matter what cpu level is, even if the board size is kept constant due to some random move choice implementation)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
If a human player is in the game, the game can be aborted at any point by having the human player hit cancel  or "x" instead of selecting a move.
If only CPU players are in the game, the game will not stop unless terminated.
