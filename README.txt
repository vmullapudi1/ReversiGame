ReversiGame Readme
----------------------------------------------------------------
Vishruth Mullapudi, CS 2336.001 F17 Final Project.
How to run program:
Run the main method in Reversi_Main (recommended, produces board state records to System.out)
-or-
Run the ReversiGame.jar (doesn't print board states to system.out, only current board and no previous moves visible due to output being in dialog boxes)

Notes:
If a human player is in the game, the game can be aborted at any point by having the human player hit cancel  or "x" instead of selecting a move.
If only CPU players are in the game, the game will not stop unless terminated.
